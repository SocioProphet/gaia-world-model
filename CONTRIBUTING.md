# Contributing

We accept contributions that improve:
- provenance + attribution
- ontology quality (coherence, minimality, validation)
- adapters (reproducible ingestion)
- policy gates and audits

## Workflow

1) Open an issue (use templates)
2) Create a branch: `feat/<topic>` or `fix/<topic>`
3) Keep changes small and attributable
4) Add/update manifests if new sources are introduced
5) Run validation (when SHACL tooling lands)

## Non-negotiables

- Do not remove attribution.
- Do not introduce restrictive licenses into GAIA original work without discussion.
- Prefer conservative alignments (SKOS) until semantics are proven.
