# Third-Party Notices

This repository contains third-party materials under gaia/cv/ that are vendored for reproducibility.

## Licenses
- Original GAIA wrapper code and original documentation are MIT licensed unless otherwise noted.
- Third-party sources retain their original licenses.

## Where license evidence is tracked
For each vendored source, we record provenance and license evidence pointers in:
- gaia/cv/origins.csv (upstream URL + pinned commit SHA)
- gaia/cv/manifests/*.json (per-source provenance and license evidence pointers)

If a source has additional license files upstream, they should be referenced in its manifest.
