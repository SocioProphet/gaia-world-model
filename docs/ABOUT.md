# About GAIA World Model

GAIA World Model exists to build a **responsible, auditable digital twinning framework** for Earth.

Our core stance: world models must be **checkable**.
Provenance, semantics, and actionability must be explicit and reproducible.

## Why this exists

Many “world model” efforts optimize for prediction/generation. GAIA optimizes for responsibility:
- provenance that survives scrutiny
- semantics that are explicit and testable
- actions that can be audited and constrained
- integrations that can be reproduced from pinned sources

## What “digital twinning” means here

A digital twin is a versioned representation of:
- entities (places, systems, infrastructures)
- states (observations, measurements, derived indicators)
- hypotheses (explicitly labeled, testable)
- actions (what interventions are allowed, under what policies, with what audits)

Near-term objective: build the spine — ontology + provenance + validation + action semantics.
