# GAIA in the Global AI and Knowledge Commons (and the SocioProphet stack)

GAIA World Model is the Earth-domain spine of the SocioProphet ecosystem: it curates sources, pins provenance, and turns world modeling into checkable engineering artifacts rather than opaque claims.

## What GAIA provides
- Curation Vault (CV): pinned origins, hashes, manifests, storage policy
- Canonical entrypoints: explicit ontology integration map
- Reproducibility posture: independently verifiable outputs
- Commons compatibility: licensing clarity + attribution discipline

## How GAIA plugs into the stack
- TriTRPC transport for tools/agents operating on GAIA resources
- Capability registry with contracts + policies
- Workflow IR that binds discovered resources into runnable pipelines
- Assessment harness (interop/repro/policy scorecards + conformance tests)
- Governance layer (promotion gates for sources, adapters, semantic changes)

## The commons contract
- claims come with provenance
- workflows come with reproducibility bundles
- interoperability is enforced via contracts (not implied)
- policy/consent boundaries are first-class
- the ecosystem improves via gap reports and contribution loops
