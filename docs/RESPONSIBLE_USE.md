# Responsible Use

GAIA is for responsible Earth stewardship and public-interest analysis.
We explicitly reject “world modeling” as a euphemism for covert surveillance or harm.

## We will not build features intended for:
- covert tracking of individuals
- doxyng, harassment, intimidation, or targeted manipulation
- unlawful surveillance or rights-violating monitoring
- weaponization of geospatial or biosurveillance data against civilians

## Guardrails
- Prefer public, consented, or appropriately aggregated data.
- Preserve provenance and license constraints.
- Make uncertainty explicit: label hypotheses vs facts.
- Keep policy enforcement and audit logs as first-class outputs.
