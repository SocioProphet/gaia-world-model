# TritRPC integration (Path A)\n\nWe treat TritRPC v1 as a first class wire for capabilities and workflows.\n\nPath A assumptions:\n- Payload bytes use Avro binary encoding\n- Semantics use JSON LD context\n- schema_id and context_id are both required on the wire and in the registry\n\nSchema SALAD is the authoring bridge between Avro types and JSON LD predicates.\nWe pin it in schema_bundle.salad_ref (URL or local vendored copy).\n\nDeterminism gotcha:\nAvro maps are logically unordered. Byte determinism requires a stable key order.\nFor Path A we require lexicographic ordering by key when encoding map entries.\n\nSecond pass (Path B):\nWe will add path-b later. For now the validator rejects any profile other than path-a.\n\n\n
